Medical Insurance Project

📝 Overview

This repository contains a Python-based solution for analyzing medical insurance data. The project uses Python to manipulate and evaluate customer insurance information, providing insights into costs and demographic patterns. It also includes the implementation of a class structure for handling and analyzing insurance data effectively.

📂 Structure

    Data Preparation:
        Simulating customer insurance data for analysis.
        Preparing the dataset for further processing.
    Insurance Class Implementation:
        Creating a MedicalInsurance class to handle customer data.
        Adding methods for calculating average insurance costs and other statistics.
    Analysis and Insights:
        Extracting and summarizing trends from the dataset.
        Calculating and visualizing insurance metrics.
