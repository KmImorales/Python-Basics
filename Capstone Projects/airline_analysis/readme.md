# Airline Analysis

📝 **Overview**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook solution for analyzing airline flight data. The analysis focuses on exploring flight pricing, delays, and other key factors affecting the airline industry. The project uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover insights into how various factors, such as flight duration, day of the week, and redeye status, impact coach and first-class ticket prices.

📂 **Structure**

- **Data Import**: Loading and cleaning the airline dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing flight prices, delays, and flight characteristics (such as redeye flights).
- **Ticket Price Analysis**: Analyzing the relationship between coach and first-class ticket prices.
- **Flight Delay Analysis**: Exploring flight delay times and their distribution.
- **Visualizations**: Providing meaningful visualizations to highlight key insights.

💡 **Key Topics Covered**

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Relationship between Coach and First-Class Prices
- Flight Delay Patterns and Factors
- Visualization Techniques (e.g., Boxplots, Scatter Plots)

🚀 **Highlights**

- Insights:
  - Identified factors that influence coach and first-class ticket prices.
  - Analyzed flight delays to understand potential risks for connecting flights.
  
- Techniques:
  - Correlation analysis between different flight factors and ticket prices.
  - Visualized price differences across different days of the week and flight statuses.
