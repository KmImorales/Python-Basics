    "\n",
    "- This notebook is part of a project designed to develop and demonstrate skills in business intelligence and data analysis. The focus is to perform data analysis using Python by implementing key programming and analytical techniques.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Project Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Work locally on your own computer**\n",
    "- All tasks are performed locally, ensuring familiarity with file management and local development tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Import a dataset into your program**\n",
    "- Load data from files (e.g., CSV, Excel, etc.) and prepare it for analysis by addressing any data loading issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods**\n",
    "- Write reusable functions or classes to clean, process, and extract insights from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Use libraries to assist in your analysis**\n",
    "- Leverage Python libraries such as `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation, computation, and visualization.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Optional Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Document and organize your findings**\n",
    "- Summarize insights, observations, and results to ensure clarity and potential sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Make predictions about a datasetâ€™s features based on your findings**\n",
    "- Apply predictive modeling techniques (optional) to make informed projections about dataset trends.\n",
