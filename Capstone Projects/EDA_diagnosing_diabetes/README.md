# EDA Diagnosing Diabetes
📝 **Overview**

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a diabetes dataset. The goal is to understand the structure of the dataset, handle missing values, detect outliers, and prepare the data for further analysis. Key insights from the dataset are drawn using visualization and statistical methods.

📂 **Structure**

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Replaced invalid `0` values in columns like `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, and `BMI` with `NaN` for meaningful imputation.
   - Explored strategies to handle missing data using mean and median imputation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualized missing data patterns and correlations using heatmaps.
   - Detected and analyzed outliers using boxplots and z-scores.
   - Explored the distribution of values in each column using `.value_counts()`.

3. **Insights and Outcomes**:
   - Identified significant missing data in columns like `Insulin` and `SkinThickness`.
   - Highlighted outliers in numeric columns and suggested ways to handle them.
   - Cleaned the dataset to ensure reliability for further machine learning or statistical modeling.

💡 **Key Topics Covered**

- Handling Missing Data:
  - Replacing invalid values with `NaN`.
  - Imputation techniques (mean and median).

- Outlier Detection:
  - Visualization with boxplots.
  - Statistical analysis using z-scores.

- Data Visualization:
  - Heatmaps for missing data.
  - Value distributions and patterns.

🚀 **Highlights**

1. **Techniques**:
   - Comprehensive data cleaning and preparation.
   - Identification of overlapping missing data patterns.
   - Outlier analysis using visual and statistical methods.

2. **Tools**:
   - Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`.
