# Exploring Mushrooms

📝 **Overview**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook solution for exploring mushroom data. The analysis focuses on identifying different mushroom species based on various attributes such as cap shape, color, and other physical features. The dataset is used to explore machine learning models for classification, and the project aims to provide insights into how these features relate to the edibility of mushrooms.

📂 **Structure**

- **Data Import**: Loading and cleaning the mushroom dataset.
- **Data Exploration**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between mushroom features and species.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for machine learning by encoding categorical features.
- **Modeling**: Building classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict mushroom species.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

💡 **Key Topics Covered**

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Categorical Feature Encoding
- Classification Models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

🚀 **Highlights**

- Insights:
  - Identified key features influencing mushroom species classification.
  - Built a model with high prediction accuracy for edibility.
  
- Techniques:
  - Used decision tree classifiers and random forests to classify mushrooms.
  - Applied cross-validation for model evaluation.
